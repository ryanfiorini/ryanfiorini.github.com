      <h3>About</h3>

      <p>I am a software developer currently focusing on high performance mobile HTML5.  My background is web base application development using PHP, C#, Python and Ruby.  I've worked on small websites, intranets, video sharing sites and student health portals.  I've scaled applications to handle millions of records in a table consuming over 6 gigs of data.</p>

      <h3>jqMobi/jqUi</h3>
      <p>I created jqMobi and jqUi to fill the bridge of mobile HTML5 frameworks.  Android appears to have been ignored by frameworks, with many bugs preventing normal use.  Performance was always a crux, with some frameworks calling it "broken" and degrading peformance.<br><br>
        The goal of jqUi was to make Android a first class browser, and jqUi does that.  It performs great on Android and even better on iOS.  We include fixes for many of the known bugs, especially -webkit-transform:translate3d and transitions.  With jqMobi, we wanted the sytnax of jQuery but focus on mobile where size and speed matters.  We made micro optimzations and independent tests have proven jqMobi is the fasts mobile query selector engine.  

        <br><br>
        Badoo has become a core contributor, making great enhancements to the 1.1 branch.  The base was developed as they were implementing their mobile HTML5 web application.  This is the first time an off the shelf framework was used in a high deployment web app.  Badoo currently has over 160 million users, with mobile HTML5 making up a large portion.
